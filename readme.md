1. Begin with $n$ distinct routes, this means every customer is served by a vehicle
2. If 2 customers can be served by one vehicle and the total distance can be saved, combine these 2 customers with one route
3. Restrict the waiting time, a large waiting time may influence the combination of other customers.
